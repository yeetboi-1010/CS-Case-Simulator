<h1><i>Luca's Case Opening Simulator</i></h1>
<p>Hey there! Ever wanted to roll the dice in Counter-Strike without worrying about spending a dime? Now you can in this simulator! Note that none of these skins you open on this website are real, and are simply for educational purposes. Again, the skins you open here are not real and therefore can't be transferred to CS! This took TONS of time to make, and I plan on updating it too! Hope you enjoy, and for more projects like this, make sure to check out <a href="https://yeetboi-1010.github.io/PortfolioWebsiteV1/index.html">my website!</a></p>
